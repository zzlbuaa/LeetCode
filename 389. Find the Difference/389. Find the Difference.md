# 389. Find the Difference

### Description:

Given two strings **s** and **t** which consist of only lowercase letters.

String **t** is generated by random shuffling string **s** and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in **t**.

### Solution:

#### 1.Sum

```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int sum_asc_s = 0;
        int sum_asc_t = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
            sum_asc_s += (int)s.charAt(i);
        }
        for(int i=0; i<t.length(); i++) {
            sum_asc_t += (int)t.charAt(i);
        }
        return (char)(sum_asc_t - sum_asc_s);
    }
}
```

Note: Pay attention to the transition between String and char here.

# TODO

More methods (bit manipulation probably). Not the fastest yet.
